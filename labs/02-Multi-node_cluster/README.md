# Kubernetes multi-node cluster with Vagrant + Virtualbox + Kubeadm

Virtualbox + Vagrant + kubectl have to be installed on the host machine as a prerequisite (see [00-Prerequisites](../00-Prerequisites/README.md))

All the istructions here after have to be run on the host machine.

Install vagrant plugins
```console
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbguest
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-reload
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostmanager
```
If you installed the latest versions of Vagrant (2.2.6) and VirtualBox (6.1.x) you may face compatibility problems. 
To avoid them you can follow this guide:

Provision the environent

```console
$ cd vagrant
vagrant$ vagrant up
```

Test the environment

```console
vagrant$ export KUBECONFIG=$(pwd)/kubeconfig.yaml
vagrant$ kubectl get nodes

NAME     STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
master   Ready    master   18h   v1.15.3
node1    Ready    <none>   17h   v1.15.3
node2    Ready    <none>   17h   v1.15.3
```

Download kuberang utility [here](https://github.com/apprenda/kuberang/releases) and test the cluster

```console
vagrant$ ./kuberang

You need to proxy your requests to access the Dashboard

```console
vagrant$ kubectl proxy
```

Then point your browser to http://localhost:8001/api/v1/namespaces/kubernetes-dashboard/services/https:kubernetes-dashboard:/proxy/.

or create a public port-forward:

````
$ kubectl port-forward svc/kubernetes-dashboard --address='0.0.0.0' -n kubernetes-dashboard 9999:443
```

Then point your browser to https://\<FQ machine name\>:9999

(The TLS cert must be accepted since it is not valid)
